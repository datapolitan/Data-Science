# Data-Science Cheatsheet

+ **Open-Source Software** - software source code is freely available to anyone for download, alteration, and republishing. Open source software code is generally supported by a mix of paid and volunteer professionals who contribute changes back to the community. Contrasts with proprietary software source code, which is owned by an individual or an organization and tightly restricted (usually for profit).

+ **Machine readable data** - data in a format that allows it to be easily read by a computer program, either by being marked by explanatory tags (like HTML) or in a structured format that allows it to be easily parsed (XML, JSON)

+ **Relational database** - a data storage system consisting of multiple data tables linked together with index values. While relational databases are useful for reliably storing and processing data, they often require a good deal of design and planning to function properly.  

+ **SQL** - Structure Query Language. A special programming language for adding, managing, and retrieving data in relational databases

+ **PostgreSQL** - an open-source relational database management system. Like most relational database systems, PostgreSQL uses a slightly varied version of standard SQL as the means to add, manage, process, and retrieve data stored in tables.

+ **NoSQL/non-relational databases** - a data storage system that doesn't store data in relational structure, often as a document store. NoSQL databases require far less design and planning than relational databases and can be more scalable but suffer from issues of data consistency and reliability. 

+ **Data Size: Petabyte, Terabyte, Gigabyte, Megabyte** (in relation to one another)
    + 1 Petabyte = 1,024 Terabytes (20 million four-drawer filing cabinets filled with text)
    + 1 Terabyte = 1,024 Gigabytes (1,500 CD-ROMs)
    + 1 Gigabyte = 1.024 Megabytes (7 minutes of HD-TV video)

+ **Algorithm** - A precise set of instructions required to accomplish a task. Roughly broken down into three components: inputs, operation, output. Each step in the operation must be clearly defined and work the same with any input.

+ **Data Model(ing)/Predictive Modeling** - using data collected about events or phenomena in the past to predict future outcomes. Predictive models can be constructed using any of a number of algorithms, either singularly or together, to achieve the desired outcome. A model's predictive power is assessed using various measures that help determine relative performance of one model over another.

+ **Machine learning** - similar to predictive modeling, but more specifically focused on the use of computer systems to create predictive models with data.

+ **Regression/Logistic Regression** - A predictive modeling technique that relies on the linear relationship between two variables to make predictions when the value for only one of the variables is known. For example, given a known relationship between height and weight in the general population, it's possible to predict an individual's weight given only his/her height.

+ **Random Forests** - a machine learning algorithm that uses a collection of various predictive models constructed on a random selection of features from the training data.

+ **Python** - Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

+ **R** - a programming language and freely available software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. It has a command line interface and several graphical front-ends, the most popular is called RStudio. 

+ **GitHub** - Github is the largest repository of source code in the world. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub is a web-based hosting service offering all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
