# Data-Science Cheatsheet

+ **Open-Source Software** - software source code is freely available to anyone for download, alteration, and republishing. Open source software code is generally supported by a mix of paid and volunteer professionals who contribute changes back to the community. Contrasts with proprietary software source code, which is owned by an individual or an organization and tightly restricted (usually for profit).

+ **Data warehouse/Data Mart/Data Store** - a centralized repository of integrated data, organized for easily accessibility in support of business intelligence and operational decision-making.

+ **Metadata** - data that provides information on other data. This could be data on the structure of a dataset or a description of the content of a particular dataset. 

+ **Machine readable data** - data in a format that allows it to be easily read by a computer program, either by being marked by explanatory tags (like HTML) or in a structured format that allows it to be easily parsed (XML, JSON)

+ **Relational database** - a data storage system consisting of multiple data tables linked together with index values. While relational databases are useful for reliably storing and processing data, they often require a good deal of design and planning to function properly.  

+ **SQL** - **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage. A special programming language for adding, managing, and retrieving data in relational databases

+ **PostgreSQL** - an open-source relational database management system. Like most relational database systems, PostgreSQL uses a slightly varied version of standard SQL as the means to add, manage, process, and retrieve data stored in tables.

+ **NoSQL/non-relational databases** - a data storage system that doesn't store data in relational structure, often as a document store. NoSQL databases require far less design and planning than relational databases and can be more scalable but suffer from issues of data consistency and reliability. 

+ **MongoDB** - one of the most-used open-source NoSQL database systems. Instead of using tables, data is stored as a singular document with key-value pairs. Raw data can be easily loaded into the database and easily retrieved, but the data isn't as well indexed or easy to join with other data compared to relational database systems.

+ **Data Size: Petabyte, Terabyte, Gigabyte, Megabyte** (in relation to one another)
    + 1 Petabyte = 1,024 Terabytes (20 million four-drawer filing cabinets filled with text)
    + 1 Terabyte = 1,024 Gigabytes (1,500 CD-ROMs)
    + 1 Gigabyte = 1.024 Megabytes (7 minutes of HD-TV video)

+ **Algorithm** - A precise set of instructions required to accomplish a task. Roughly broken down into three components: inputs, operation, output. Each step in the operation must be clearly defined and work the same with any input.

+ **Data Model(ing)/Predictive Modeling** - using data collected about events or phenomena in the past to predict future outcomes. Predictive models can be constructed using any of a number of algorithms, either singularly or together, to achieve the desired outcome. A model's predictive power is assessed using various measures that help determine relative performance of one model over another.

+ **Machine learning** - similar to predictive modeling, but more specifically focused on the use of computer systems to create predictive models with data.

+ **Model Tuning** - Altering initial model parameters to achieve a better or more desirably result with the predictive model.

+ **Regression/Logistic Regression** - A predictive modeling technique that relies on the linear relationship between two variables to make predictions when the value for only one of the variables is known. For example, given a known relationship between height and weight in the general population, it's possible to predict an individual's weight given only his/her height.

+ **Classification** - Like regression, a supervised predictive modeling technique using a known relationship between attributes to predict the category of an unseen instance. For example, using information about a borrower, including their income, age, credit score, and other information, to predict whether they're at risk of defaulting on their loan. 

+ **Clustering** - an unsupervised machine learning technique for mathematically determing groups of objects that are similar to one another and different from the objects in other groups.

+ **Natural Language Processing** - a set of machine learning techniques to model the meaning contained in human language. This includes techniques to provide automatic translations, determine the sentiment of statements, and recognize handwriting.

+ **AdaBoost** - a machine learning technique combining the output of multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve a better result. 

+ **Random Forests** - a machine learning algorithm that uses a collection of various predictive models constructed on a random selection of features from the training data.

+ **Python** - Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

+ **R** - a programming language and freely available software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. It has a command line interface and several graphical front-ends, the most popular is called RStudio. 

+ **GitHub** - Github is the largest repository of source code in the world. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub is a web-based hosting service offering all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
